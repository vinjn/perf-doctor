Usage: simpleperf report [options]
The default options are: -i perf.data --sort comm,pid,tid,dso,symbol.
-b    Use the branch-to addresses in sampled take branches instead of the
      instruction addresses. Only valid for perf.data recorded with -b/-j
      option.
--children    Print the overhead accumulated by appearing in the callchain.
              In the report, Children column shows overhead for a symbol and functions called
              by the symbol, while Self column shows overhead for the symbol itself.
--csv                     Report in csv format.
--csv-separator <sep>     Set separator for csv columns. Default is ','.
--full-callgraph  Print full call graph. Used with -g option. By default,
                  brief call graph is printed.
-g [callee|caller]    Print call graph. If callee mode is used, the graph
                      shows how functions are called from others. Otherwise,
                      the graph shows how functions call others.
                      Default is caller mode.
-i <file>  Specify path of record file, default is perf.data.
--kallsyms <file>     Set the file to read kernel symbols.
--max-stack <frames>  Set max stack frames shown when printing call graph.
-n         Print the sample count for each item.
--no-demangle         Don't demangle symbol names.
--no-show-ip          Don't show vaddr in file for unknown symbols.
-o report_file_name   Set report file name, default is stdout.
--percent-limit <percent>  Set min percentage in report entries and call graphs.
--print-event-count   Print event counts for each item. Additional events can be added by
                      --add-counter in record cmd.
--raw-period          Report period count instead of period percentage.
--sort key1,key2,...  Select keys used to group samples into report entries. Samples having
                      the same key values are aggregated into one report entry. Each report
                      entry is printed in one row, having columns to show key values.
                      Possible keys include:
                        pid             -- process id
                        tid             -- thread id
                        comm            -- thread name (can be changed during
                                           the lifetime of a thread)
                        dso             -- shared library
                        symbol          -- function name in the shared library
                        vaddr_in_file   -- virtual address in the shared
                                           library
                      Keys can only be used with -b option:
                        dso_from        -- shared library branched from
                        dso_to          -- shared library branched to
                        symbol_from     -- name of function branched from
                        symbol_to       -- name of function branched to
                      The default sort keys are:
                        comm,pid,tid,dso,symbol
--symfs <dir>         Look for files with symbols relative to this directory.
--vmlinux <file>      Parse kernel symbols from <file>.

Sample filter options:
--comms comm1,comm2,...          Report only for threads with selected names.
--cpu   cpu_item1,cpu_item2,...  Report samples on the selected cpus. cpu_item can be cpu
                                 number like 1, or cpu range like 0-3.
--dsos dso1,dso2,...             Report only for selected dsos.
--pids pid1,pid2,...             Same as '--include-pid'.

--exclude-thread-name thread_name_regex     Exclude samples for threads with name containing
                                            the regular expression.

                                            the regular expression.
--filter-file <file>          Use filter file to filter samples based on timestamps. The
                              file format is in doc/sampler_filter.md.
